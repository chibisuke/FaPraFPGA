- PLL as "FastClk" (fclk)
	100MHz = 10ns per cycle - the max the SRAM chip can do according to the datasheet.
	if we manage to take exactly one clkcycle for each memory access 100MHz will give us max speed.
	
- MemTest suit
	we should be able to keep the critical paths short enougth to have the whole memory test run on FCLK
	that way we can save a lot of overhead on properly syncronizing the clocks
	the only clock domain transition is then to the LCD. 
	
- clock domain transition
	Even though we're allowed to skip proper syncronization for the data that are sent to the LCD, the trigger Signal that triggers the update
	of the LCD is just a pulse. So we should take care of proper Clock Domain Crossing there. 
	This requires to Keep the pulse high for Long enougth that a single Clock cycle of the slower Clock can pick it up. 
	Theoretically the absolute Minimum is 2 Clock cycles, but taking the runetime of the Signal and some clock drift into Account,
	there might be situations where it doesn't work out. so we should go for 3 Clock cycles. 
	the testsuit should Buffer the Signal in a single Register, then the LCD Logic can Takeover the Signal and syncronize it using
	a two stage Flipflop Buffer.
