- RNG:
	needs a value from between 0 and 120x
	clk is fast (50MHz) 
	if we use a counter from the clock and device the lowest bits we get a cycle interval of 2us when the user presses a button, so we can use this as real random value seed.
	if we need multiple values we can use some kind of permutation 
	=DONE

- BCD Saturation counter
	=DONE
- Init ROM 
	= Copy from V4
	- Update CHAR RAM

- Position RAM (7bit)
	special values:
		- diamond: 0x8e
		- empty: 0x8f
		- head: 0x8d
	contains the address of the next segment
	- Tail register
	- Head register
- RAM with memory mapped registers
- I2C Writer
- LCD Writer
- LCD Logic
- Mode selector 
- Speed selector
- Frequency divider
- Game Logic
	-Head register
	-Tail register
	-length register
	For each tick:
		- calculate position of next segment (based on mode selector and head register)
		- read next segment ram (to check if its already used / if its a diamond)
		- if already used or is wall
			- disable GameLogic and trigger GameOver screen
		- if not used:
			- write next segment to ram
			- update cell containing the head
			- update head register
		- if not a diamond or max length exceeded
			- read tail segment
			- clear tail segment
			- update tail register
		- inform LCD Logic to update display
- Game over screen
